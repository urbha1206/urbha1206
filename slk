### Step 2: Configure dbt Cloud to Use the Slack Webhook

1. **Log in to dbt Cloud**:
   - Go to [dbt Cloud](https://cloud.getdbt.com/) and log in with your credentials.

2. **Navigate to the Job You Want to Set Up Notifications For**:
   - From the sidebar, go to **Deploy** > **Jobs**.
   - Select the job that you want to receive Slack notifications for.

3. **Scroll to the Notifications Section**:
   - On the jobâ€™s configuration page, scroll down to the **Notifications** section.

4. **Add a New Notification**:
   - Click **Add Notification**.

5. **Choose Webhook as the Notification Type**:
   - In the dropdown for **Notification Type**, select **Webhook**.

6. **Paste the Slack Webhook URL**:
   - In the **Webhook URL** field, paste the **Slack Webhook URL** you copied from Step 1.

7. **Set the Notification Conditions**:
   - You can choose when the notification should be sent:
     - **On Job Success**: Notification is sent when the job completes successfully.
     - **On Job Failure**: Notification is sent when the job fails.
     - **On Job Skipped**: Notification is sent if the job is skipped.
     - **On Job Canceled**: Notification is sent if the job is canceled.
   - Choose any or all of these options depending on your needs.

8. **Save the Notification**:
   - Once the webhook URL is set, click **Save**.

### Step 3: Test the Integration

1. **Manually Run the Job in dbt Cloud**:
   - To verify the integration, manually trigger a run of the job in dbt Cloud by clicking **Run Job**.
   
2. **Check Slack for the Notification**:
   - After the job runs, go to your designated Slack channel (where the webhook was configured) and check for the notification.
   - The message will typically include the job name, status, and details like start time, end time, and any other relevant information.

---

### Example Slack Message from Webhook

The message that Slack receives might look something like this:

```
ðŸš¨ **dbt Job Failure**
Job Name: `dbt_daily_refresh`
Status: `Failed`
Duration: `7 minutes`
Timestamp: `2024-10-09 13:45:00`
Check the details here: [dbt Cloud Job URL]
```

You can customize the notification payload in dbt Cloud, but the default webhook message contains key information such as the job status and a link to the dbt Cloud job details.

---

### Customization (Optional)

Although dbt Cloudâ€™s webhook payload is fairly straightforward, if you need more control over message formatting, you can:
- **Build a middleware** service to catch the webhook from dbt Cloud, process the data (e.g., format it, add extra metadata), and send it to Slack using the Slack Web API.
- **Use third-party automation tools** like Zapier or Make (formerly Integromat) to intercept the dbt webhook, customize it, and send it to Slack.

---

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you'll have dbt Cloud job notifications sent directly to a Slack channel via an Incoming Webhook. This integration helps keep your team informed about the status of data transformations in real-time, allowing quick actions on job failures or other critical events.


--------------------------------------------------------

To integrate Slack notifications without using a specific dbt app but instead utilizing webhooks, you can follow these steps. This method involves creating a custom webhook URL in Slack and configuring dbt Cloud to send notifications via that webhook whenever specific events (like job completion, failure, etc.) occur.

### Step 1: Create a Webhook in Slack

1. **Log in to Your Slack Workspace**:

   - From the sidebar, go to **Deploy** > **Jobs**.
   - Select the job that you want to receive Slack notifications for.

3. **Scroll to the Notifications Section**:
   - On the job configuration page, scroll down until you see the **Notifications** section.
   
4. **Add a Webhook Notification**:
   - Click **Add Notification**.
   - In the **Notification Type** dropdown, choose **Webhook**.

5. **Paste the Slack Webhook URL**:
   - In the **Webhook URL** field, paste the **Webhook URL** you copied from Slack in Step 1.

6. **Set Notification Triggers**:
   - You can configure dbt Cloud to send notifications to Slack based on certain job statuses:
     - **On Success**: Sends a notification when the job completes successfully.
     - **On Failure**: Sends a notification if the job fails.
     - **On Skipped**: Notifies if the job is skipped.
     - **On Cancelled**: Sends a notification if the job is canceled.
   
7. **Save the Notification**:
   - Once youâ€™ve set up the Webhook URL and chosen the triggers, click **Save**.

### Step 3: Test the Integration

1. **Manually Run the Job**:
   - Go back to your list of jobs in dbt Cloud and manually trigger a run by clicking on **Run Job**.

2. **Check Slack for the Notification**:
   - Depending on the outcome of the job (success, failure, etc.), you should see a message posted in the designated Slack channel.

### Example of Slack Notification Content

A typical Slack message sent via the webhook may look like this:

```
ðŸš¨ **dbt Job Failure**
Job Name: `dbt_daily_refresh`
Status: `Failed`
Duration: `6 minutes`
Finished At: `2024-10-09 12:30:45 UTC`
Link: <dbt Job URL>
```

By default, dbt Cloud sends basic job information (e.g., job name, status, and duration) via the webhook, and Slack will post it in the configured channel.

---

### Advanced Options for Webhook Customization

If you want to customize the notifications further or use the Webhook in more sophisticated workflows:

1. **Custom Formatting**:
   - You can use a third-party service (like **Zapier** or **Make** formerly Integromat) to intercept the dbt webhook payload and reformat the message before it is sent to Slack. This allows you to add custom emojis, mentions, or adjust the text layout.
   
2. **Error Handling and Retries**:
   - You can build a simple service that listens to dbt webhooks and processes them before sending them to Slack, adding features like retries or logging failures.

3. **Custom Services**:
   - If you need to enrich the dbt notifications (e.g., by adding metadata or job-specific details), you could build a small custom server to process the incoming webhook data from dbt and forward it to Slack in your desired format.

By following these steps, you'll have dbt Cloud notifications sent directly to Slack without using the dbt Slack integration app, but instead leveraging Slack's Webhook capability.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 3: Test the Integration

1. **Manually Run the Job**:
   - Go back to your list of jobs, and click on **Run Job** to manually trigger the job.
   
2. **Check Slack for Notifications**:
   - If the job succeeds or fails (based on your settings), you should receive a message in the Slack channel you configured.
   - The message will contain information about the job, such as the job ID, status, duration, and timestamp.

---

### Step 4: Customize Notifications (Optional)

You can customize the message format that dbt sends to Slack by modifying the payload sent via the Webhook. While dbt doesn't natively allow customization of the payload directly, you could handle this outside dbt (by sending the webhook to a custom service that processes and reformats the message before sending it to Slack).

1. **Additional Notification Types**:
   - You can add multiple webhook notifications for different events:
     - Success, Failure, Skipped, Canceled, or even on warnings.
   
2. **Multiple Channels**:
   - You can set up different Webhooks for different channels. For example, failures can go to an **#alert** channel, while successes might be posted to a general **#data** channel.

---

### Example of How Slack Notification Will Look:

A Slack notification might look something like this:

```
ðŸš¨ **dbt Job Failure**
Job Name: `dbt_daily_refresh`
Status: `Failed`
Duration: `5 minutes`
Timestamp: `2024-10-09 12:34:56`
Check the details here: [dbt Cloud Job URL]
```

---

### Step 5: (Optional) Advanced Use Cases

1. **Set up additional workflows in Slack**:
   - You can integrate Slack Workflow Builder to automatically notify team members or create follow-up tasks when specific job conditions are met (e.g., failure notifications trigger follow-up alerts or assign tasks to engineers).
   
2. **Use Third-Party Tools for More Control**:
   - If you need to customize the payload more deeply, consider using a service like Zapier or building a custom server to receive the webhook, process the data, and send it to Slack with custom formatting.

With these steps, you'll have dbt Cloud jobs sending updates to Slack, making it easier to track job performance and act promptly on issues.
