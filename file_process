Here's a detailed analysis of the `file_processing_util.py` code, broken down step-by-step to align with your request:

### Analysis of `file_processing_util.py`

**Step 1 - Initialization:**
- The `__init__` method initializes various attributes for the `FileProcessor` class:
  - `input_folder`: Directory path for input files.
  - `output_folder`: Directory path where the concatenated results will be saved.
  - `output_filename`: Name of the file to store concatenated results.
  - `ctm_order_date`: The Control-M order date, used for timestamping.
  - `synch_file_path_for_pre_post`: Path for the synchronization log file.
  - `source_file_pre_fix`: Prefix for source files that are to be processed.
  - `source_file_extension`: Extension of the source files.
  - `processed_file_abs_path`: Absolute path to the processed files directory.
  - `copy_or_move_to_processed`: Boolean flag indicating whether to copy or move files after processing.
- Sets up logging to track and manage processes, with log messages written to 'File_processor_log.log'.

**Step 2 - Change File Permissions:**
- The `file_permission_change()` method modifies the permissions and ownership of a file to ensure appropriate access.
- **Arguments**:
  - `file_name_with_abs_path`: The absolute path of the file whose permissions are to be modified.

**Step 3 - Create Temporary Synchronization File:**
- The `create_temp_synchronization_file()` method generates a temporary log file that records processed files, including details such as the order date, job name, and timestamp.
- **Arguments**:
  - `order_date`: Date associated with the current order.
  - `list_of_files`: List of files to be logged.
  - `ast_name`: Asset name for the log file.
  - `output_folder`: Folder where the log file will be saved.

**Step 4 - Remove Special Characters:**
- The `clean_special_characters()` method removes special characters (like commas and dollar signs) from a specified column in a DataFrame.
- **Arguments**:
  - `df`: The DataFrame to be cleaned.
  - `column_name`: The column name from which special characters should be removed.

**Step 5 - Create Folder If Not Exists:**
- The `create_folder_if_not_exist()` method checks whether a specified directory exists; if not, it creates the directory with appropriate permissions (mode 0o777).
- **Arguments**:
  - `folder_path`: The path of the folder to check or create.

**Step 6 - Delete Files Older Than N Days:**
- The `delete_files_older_than_n_days()` method deletes files that are older than a specified number of days (default is 5 days).
- **Arguments**:
  - `folder_path`: Path of the folder from which old files will be deleted.
  - `days`: Number of days to use as the threshold for deleting files.

**Step 7 - Rename Processed Files and Delete Old Files from NAS:**
- The `processed_file_rename_and_delete_old_files_from_nas()` method renames processed files and deletes old files from a NAS (Network Attached Storage) directory.
- **Arguments**:
  - `concatenate_file_nas_path`: Path to the NAS directory containing concatenated files.
  - `asst_name`: Asset name for the processed files.
  - `temp_file_nas_path`: Path to the temporary NAS directory.

**Step 8 - Move or Copy Files:**
- The `move_or_copy_file()` method checks if a source file exists and performs actions based on the `copy_flag`:
  - Copies the file if the flag is set to `True`.
  - Moves the file if the flag is set to `False`.
- **Arguments**:
  - `source_path`: Path of the source file.
  - `destination_folder`: Destination folder path for copied or moved files.
  - `copy_flag`: Boolean flag indicating whether to copy (`True`) or move (`False`) the file.

**Step 9 - Concatenate Files:**
- The `concatenate_files()` method concatenates multiple files into a single file based on specified prefix and extension.
- **Arguments**:
  - `source_file_abs_path`: Absolute path of the source files.
  - `output_folder_abs_path`: Absolute path where the concatenated file will be saved.
  - `output_file_name`: Name of the concatenated output file.
  - `ctm_order_date`: Control-M order date used for timestamping.
  - `source_file_prefix`: Prefix to filter source files for concatenation.
  - `source_file_extension`: Extension to filter source files for concatenation.

**Steps within Concatenation:**
- **Check if the folder exists**: Ensure that the source folder is available.
- **Check for empty strings for the prefix and extension**: Validate that the prefix and extension are provided.
- **Get a list of files**: Filter files based on the prefix and extension.
- **Check for the presence of files**: Ensure files are available for concatenation.
- **Create required folders**: Use the method from Step 5 to create output and temporary folders.
- **Create a temp synchronization file**: Use the method from Step 3 for logging.
- **Read the log file**: Extract the list of files to be processed.
- **Check if the temp file exists**: Ensure that the temp file is available at the specified location.
- **Empty the DataFrame**: Prepare an empty DataFrame for concatenation.
- **Loop through files and append data**: Load each file and append its data to the DataFrame.
- **Add file name as a column**: Include the file name in the concatenated DataFrame for traceability.
- **Compare row counts**: Verify that the merged DataFrame's row count matches the total rows in individual files.
- **Save the concatenated DataFrame to a CSV file**: Output the final DataFrame.
- **Change permissions and ownership**: Update file permissions for the output file.

**Step 10 - Merge Files Function:**
- The `merge_file()` method is essentially another call to the `concatenate_files()` method, performing a file merge operation.

**Step 11 - Rename and Delete Older Files from NAS During Post Processing:**
- The `rename_delete_processed_files()` method is called after post-processing to manage NAS files.

**Static Methods:**
- **`rename()`**: Renames files based on a given directory, filename, and file extension.
- **`unpack_archive()`**: Unpacks zip archives into a specified directory.
- **`move()`**: Moves files from a source to a destination directory.
- **`get_environment_variable()`**: Retrieves environment variables needed for processing.
- **`remove_special_character_from_header()`**: Removes special characters from the headers of a CSV file.

These steps describe the sequence of operations within the `file_processing_util.py` script, highlighting its modular design and robust error handling that facilitates flexible file processing in different environments.
