We have two folders, osl_prod and osl_sat_prod. osl_prod is scheduled to run from Saturday through Thursday at 08:23. All the folders will be running the next day morning, but for the osl_sat_prod folder, at Friday 18:00 it is running on the same day, so we want to reschedule it to run the next day, i.e., on Saturday at 18:00. Could you please help us with how to schedule this folder?

Can we hold only one job from a folder once it is loaded, so that the rest of the other jobs in a folder can be executed? If so, how can we do it?
